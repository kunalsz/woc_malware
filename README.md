Cyberlabs - Winter of Code Project - Infosec - Malware

The malware was made using python language and the script(script.py) was converted to an executable(script.exe) using pyinstaller.
For the database I used google's firebase realtime database to upload the logs and newly created files in the specific directory("Downloads" folder).
And lastly for the UI I used python's flask library along with some basic HTML and CSS.

The malware(script.py) uses external libraries like watchdog and firebase to monitor the "Downloads" folder of the PC.The executable is a standalone file.
For using the UI one has to first run the "topibaaz.py" script for which some libraries like flask need to be preinstalled. The html page "topibaaz.html" should be placed in a folder named "templates" such 
that the folder and the script are in same directory.
